# ML Pipelines for RAG


A real time machine learning system that processes news from multiple sources to enable retrieval augmented generation and data collection for LLMs finetuning.

With a real time approach, the text data becomes available in different forms for being consumed for both training and inference through a feature store. This is preferred over a batching strategy which would require a more complex synchronization between databases.

The system architecture is structured according to a multiple pipeline design pattern composed of the following modules:

- Data ingestion
- Feature pipeline
- Training: TBD
- Inference: TBD

Repository outline:

- [Data ingestion Pipeline](#data-ingestion-pipeline)
    - [MongoDB Sync](#mongodb-sync)
- [Feature Pipeline](#feature-pipeline)
- [Training](#training-pipeline)
- [Inference](#inference)
