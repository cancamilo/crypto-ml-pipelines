# Data Ingestion Pipeline

The [entry point](./main.py) of the lambda function contains the logic for extracting the data. It accepts a parameter `mode` that defines whether the extraction is run the daily or in backfill mode. 

The daily mode will extract only data for the current day. This mode is ideal for using an AWS EventBridge that schedules calls everyday at a given time.

On the other hand, the backfill mode will extract data for several days in the past and can be used for initializing both the mongoDB and the vector database with some data.
